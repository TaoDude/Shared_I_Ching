# Shared_I_Ching
Public code from the Sci-Fi your Pi Design competition I Ching Hexagrams entry.
This project contains elements of software produced by the vendors of the PiFaceCAD add-on board for the Raspbery Pi.
The vendors of the board have applied the GPL V3 licence to their code, so I have passed that licence on to anyone 
who wishes to make uas of my code.
